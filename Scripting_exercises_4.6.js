console.log(`It is frustrating at every 2nd exercise I have to ask in discord and/or search outside web addresses, just because exercise solutions/documentation links are 
either broken, outdated or content-useless in relation to exercise tasks. And even if by chance are working, the provided documentation often does not provide ways
 to solve specific task for an exercise. To be open and honest, javascript part of "My1stCodingCamp" course is not for total beginners at all, at least that's how I see it. 
 GreenFox might consider to work on that because the effect is needlessly discouraging. If just because of that I have to spend large amounts of time with searches for help 
 on various 3rd external sites and keep bothering people in discord, what is the point of attending this coding camp course in the first place... I wonder.`)
